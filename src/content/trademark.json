To ensure the integrity and protection of the <b>Safe Trademarks</b> (as defined below), to regulate the use of the Safe Trademarks, and to protect users SEF has defined this trademark policy (\"<b>Policy</b>\"). This Policy sets out the conditions and requirements under which the Safe Trademarks may be used. This Policy does not provide or amend any licenses applicable to technology published by SEF.</i> Projects operating as separately incorporated entities within the Safe ecosystem may have their own trademark policies.</p><p><i>We thank you for your cooperation in complying with this Policy.</i></p><h3>1.&emsp;Purpose and Scope of Application</h3><p>This Policy covers all of our trademarks, whether they are registered or not, including, among others:</p><ul><li>Safe Logo <br/><img src=\"/images/Trademark/safe-logo-white.png\" alt=\"Safe logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></li><li>Horizontal Logo <br/><img src=\"/images/Trademark/horizontal-logo-white.png\" alt=\"Safe horizontal logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></li><li>Vertical Logo <br/><img src=\"/images/Trademark/vertical-logo-white.png\" alt=\"Safe vertical logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"100\"></li><li>Safe{Core} Logo <br/><br/><img src=\"/images/Trademark/safe-core-logo-white.svg\" alt=\"Safe Core logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></li><li>Safe{Wallet} Logo <br/><br/><img src=\"/images/Trademark/safe-wallet-logo-white.svg\" alt=\"Safe Core logo\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\"></li></ul><p>(the \"<b>Safe Trademarks</b>\"). This list may be updated from time to time, especially as other trademarks are created or registered</p><p>This Policy applies to all parties intending to use the Safe Trademarks.</p><h3>2.&emsp;Definitions</h3><p>\"<i>Trademark Owner</i>\" refers to the Safe Ecosystem Foundation, with its registered office in Zug, Switzerland (“<b>SEF</b>”).</p><p>\"<i>Trademark User</i>\" refers to any party intending to use the Safe Trademarks.</p><p>\"<i>Commercial Trademark Use</i>\" includes any use of the Safe Trademarks in business activities aimed at generating profit or economic benefit.</p><p>\"<i>Informative Trademark Use</i>\"  includes any reference in text to and/or link to SEF primarily for the purpose of conveying relevant information about the characteristics, qualities, or attributes of SEF products or services.</p><h3>3.&emsp;Rules Applicable for SEF Trademark Use</h3><p><i>(Thes Rules mainly apply for the Informative Trademark Use as defined under Section 4 below)</i></p><p>One of the guiding principles of the SEF is Open Source. SEF both hopes and encourages external parties to share knowledge related to technology developed and published by SEF, including SAFE{CORE} and SAFE{WALLET} (“<b>Safe Technology</b>”). It also advocates the promotion of the Safe Trademarks used for products built using Safe. Therefore, contributors to and participants in the Safe ecosystem should be able to use our Safe Trademarks to promote their Safe projects even beyond the right to fair use.</p><p>However, we have to keep in mind that the <b>incorrect</b> use of a brand may lead to a dilution of the Safe Trademark and, thus, to impairment due to a lack of differentiation from other brands.Therefore, SEF established the following rules for the use of Safe Trademarks. SEF requires you to follow these guidelines to properly use the Safe Trademarks to help maintain the value of our Safe Trademarks.</p><h3>3.1&emsp;Our Five Rules for the use of Safe Trademarks</h3><p>If you want to use the Safe Trademarks, you don't require SEF’s explicit prior permission or license agreement as long as you follow these rules. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to alter and amend these rules, to determine when these rules are adhered to or violated, and to choose appropriate enforcement measures.</p><p><h3>Rule #1 The ecosystem rule</h3>Refer to Safe and/or use the Safe Trademark and logo only when promoting products, projects, or events based on or about Safe Technology, including SAFE{CORE}  and SAFE{WALLET} and in accordance with the disclaimer below. Use of the Safe Trademarks when referring to other software or technologies, would be misleading to the audience, as well as damaging to the Safe Trademarks and Safe ecosystem. Therefore, Safe Trademarks must not be used when referring to software based on protocols by other entities / projects and / or in another misleading or unfair manner. Any use of the Safe Trademarks in these contexts could potentially subject you to liability for trademark infringement, false advertising, and unfair competition.</p><p><h3>Rule #2 Use your brand and add Safe as an ingredient brand</h3>It must be clear who the owner and/or marketer of the promoted product, project, or event is.

Your name, brand, or trademark must not be less prominent than the Safe Trademarks, and Safe must not be the only visible name, brand, or trademark on your online/offline communication. To make it clear for your audience or users that Safe Technology such as SAFE{CORE} and SAFE{WALLET} is used for your project use wording such as, for example, \"<b>powered by Safe</b>\" or \"<b>powered by SAFE{CORE}</b>”.</p><p>If you are promoting a strictly non-profit and free-entry event regarding Safe Technology, SAFE{CORE}  and/or SAFE{WALLET}, you may use the Safe Trademarks as a primary brand for the event title.</p><p><h3>Rule #3 Use Safe Trademarks according to our brand guidelines</h3>Use the word Safe and/or SAFE{CORE} and/or SAFE{WALLET} in the same font and size as the surrounding text.
